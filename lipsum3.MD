Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…
No, I'm Santa Claus! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Shinier than yours, meatbag. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Why not indeed! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Now what? Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Who are those horrible orange men? And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.

Bender, quit destroying the universe!
And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.
I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Say what? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!
Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
It doesn't look so shiny to me. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.

Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! And I'm his friend Jesus. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?

Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.

Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

Now what? You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Do a flip! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Yes! In your face, Gandhi!

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!
